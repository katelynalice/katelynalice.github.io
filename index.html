<h2>Background Information</h2>

<p>My name is Katelyn Johnston and I am a senior at Eastern Washington University. My major is in Technical Communications and I have two minors in French and Visual Communication Design along with a certificate in Public Relations. I hail from Clayton, Washington which is about an hour north of Cheney, which basically makes me a native of the area. I have always had a love for design and especially that of writing code in html. In the future I hope to become an editor for Penguin Random House Publishing, but to start out I hope to get an internship and work my way up.</p>

<h2>About Me:</h2>
<ul>
  <li> I am a twin to a loving brother named Kurtis. There are telepathic capabilities, but sadly, they are not ones that I hold. My brother can sense how I am feeling no matter how far away he is; usually feelings of great intensity (extreme anger, sadness, or happiness).</li>

  <li>I am a Gemini, born on June 14th.</li>

  <li>I love country music, but will change it depending on my mood.</li>

  <li>I like to do around 5 different things while studying... in order to really soak it all in.</li>

  <li>My favorite food is cheese (I actually just took a quiz to confirm that).</li>

  <li>I believe in two things: Life is what you make it, and if you believe in yourself the possiblities are endless.</li>

  <li>I see the good in everyone and in every situation - people call me an optomist.</li>

  <li>I love cats! And really any animal - I hope to have an animal farm someday.</li>
</ul>
